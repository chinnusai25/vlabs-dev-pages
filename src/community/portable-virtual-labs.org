* Virtual Labs on College Cloud
  Virtual Labs are packaged such that the labs can run from a physical hard
  drive.  As on [2016-10-14 Fri], 68 labs are ported to run from physical hard
  drive.  

  With the virtual labs running from a physical hard drive, the outreach of
  virtual labs is extended without the need for internet connectivity.  A
  college can host a machine connected to the physical hard drive with the
  virtual labs on the local area network (LAN).  To create a bootable physical
  hard drive with the virtual labs, please send an email to engg@vlabs.ac.in.
