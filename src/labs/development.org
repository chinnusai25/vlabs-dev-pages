* Improving current Labs
  There are over 100 labs currently using different technologies.  The effort
  is to improve the labs in terms of:
  - Technology, move all the labs to use FOSS
  - Usability, ability to run the lab within a browser without any downloads
  - Pedagogy, filling the gaps in instructional quality of the labs.

* New Labs
  
  The process for creating new labs is delineated [[http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/gitlab/Community-Docs/about_newlabs][here]].
