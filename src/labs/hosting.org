* Introduction
  Virtual Labs is a mission mode project initiated by the
  Ministry of Human Resources and Development (MHRD). The
  objective of this project is to provide laboratory
  learning experience to the students who do not have access
  to adequate laboratory infrastructure. Currently there are
  around 90 labs developed by various institutes in the
  consortium.  A streamlined software development life cycle
  process followed for the development of these labs ensures
  high quality labs. This document defines the hosting
  process to be followed by the developers (open source
  community) of the Virtual Labs project.
* Purpose
  This document defines the experiment on-boarding and
  hosting process that should be followed by the developers
  of the lab while requesting the hosting of their lab on
  AWS. The roles and responsibilities of the various parties
  involved in the hosting process is also discussed in
  detailed in the document.
* Motivation
  A well defined experiment hosting and on-boarding process
  will help maintain a consistent user experience and enable
  experiment-authors to focus on the content. Consolidated
  information regarding all the deployments will also
  facilitate reporting.
* Audience
  The target audience for this document is the hosting team
  at VLEAD, IIITH and all the lab authors and owners who
  want to avail the hosting service provided by VLEAD, IIITH
  team.
* Definitions and Pre-requisites
  Vlabs hosting process will require certain prerequisites
  to be met by the experiments that need to be hosted. The
  following paragraphs define terminologies used during the
  hosting process.

** Hosting Unit
   Hosting unit is the code base/repository that will hosted
   in its enirety during the hosting process.  It will not
   be possible for a part of a hosting unit to be hosted
   separately. A hosting unit will correspond to one public
   repository.A hosting unit could be a stand alone
   experiment or could be a lab consisting of a set of
   related experiments.
   
** Repository Owner
   Each repository, corresponding to a hosting unit, will
   have one designated owner. The owner will be the single
   entity responsible for all the code that resides in the
   repository. The owner will also be the final approval
   authority for a hosting request. The owner should ensure
   that the master branch of the repository only contains
   the code that needs to be hosted. The latest code in the
   master branch should represent the hosted experiment.

   The repository owner does not have to be a person. It may
   be any uniquely identifiable entity. From the perpective
   of Virtual Labs hosting team, this entity will the single
   point of contact for all clarifications. The hosting team
   will not be responsible for any confusions arising due to
   shared accessibility of the repo owner entity.

** Requester 
   A repository owner or a developer who raises a hosting
   request.
** Tags
   The repository owner will be responsible for tagging each
   merge to the master branch. The owner will have to follow
   [[https://semver.org/][Semantic Versioning]] . In short, each version is a
   combination of three numbers (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   separated by dots. The changes to these numbers represent
   the following:
    1. MAJOR: A change incompatible with previous versions.
    2. MINOR: A backwords compatible new feature.
    3. PATCH: A backwords compatible bug fix.
   All Virtual Labs hosting request should specify a tag.

** Build Process
   Each hosting unit should have a well defined build
   process. The hosting team will treat the build process as
   a black box action.  This action will be triggerred to
   generate the artifacts to deploy.  The repository owner
   should ensure that the build process is well documented
   and functioning as desired before raising a hosting
   request.

** Testing
   The hosting process will result in a deployment with an
   accessible url.  The responsibility of testing the
   deployments will lie with the repository owner. The
   hosting team will be responsible for providing the link
   to the deployment.  The hosting team will not provide any
   testing environment. The repository owner will be
   responsible for ensuring that the hosting unit works as
   expected in their own specific testing environments.

* Hosting Process
  Virtual Labs hosting process consists of two steps - 
  1. Request the onboarding of a hosting unit 
  2. Request the hosting of hosting unit
** On-Boarding process of hosting unit 
  Each hosting unit that needs to be hosted by the Virtual
  Labs hosting team, must follow an onboarding process. The
  repository owner of the hosting unit will need to raise an
  issue of type '[[https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose][on-boarding request]]' in the
  engineers-forum. The issue will need to filled with the
  following pieces of information :
  
  1. A non-conflicting name for the hosting unit.
  2. Repository URL for the hosting unit.
  3. A designated repository owner with the following details:
     a. Repository owner name
     b. Repository owner github id
     c. Repository owner email address
     d. Repository owner phone
  4. The build command for the hosting unit along with the
     link to the build process documentation.
  5. Hardware specification including:
     a. CPU
     b. Memory
     c. Network bandwidth
  6. Software environment specification including:
     a. Host operating system with minimum compatible version
     b. Any additional software packages with minimum compatile versions
     c. Browser plugins required to view experiment
     d. DB

  Repository owner will be reponsible for keeping the above
  information current and intimating the hosting team of any
  updates/changes as and when needed.

  The hosting team will be responsible for storing the this
  information at a central location and making it available
  for all stakeholders.
 

** Hosting Process of hosting unit
   A repository owner/developer (requester ) will have to
   raise an issue of type '[[https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose][hosting request]]' in the GitHub
   repository [[https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum][engineers-forum]] under Virtual-Labs
   organisation for hosting of a hosting unit. The issue
   will need to filled with the following pieces of
   information :
  
   1. Repository URL
   2. Branch/Tag to be deployed
   3. Contact details of the repository owner
   
   A hosting request will be tied to this information.
   This issue will be a single source of truth for that
   hosting request.  All communication related to the
   hosting will be recorded on the raised hosting request.

*** Lifecycle of a Hosting Request
    
    The hosting request will go through the following
    lifecycle:

    1.  Requester will raise a hosting request issue by duly
        filling in the details in the '[[https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose][hosting request]]'.
    2.  If requester is not the repository owner, the
        hosting team will seek approval from the repository
        owner. This will be through the above created GitHub
        hosting request issue.
    3.  The hosting team will honour the hosting request
        only on receiving the approval from repository
        owner else will label the hosting request issue 
        as *Not Approved* 
    4.  On a successful hosting, the hosting team will add
        the link of the newly hosted content to the hosting
        request issue. They will also label the issue as
        *Hosted*.
    5.  However, on failure ( because of missing or
        incorrect information or repository problems,), the
        hosting team will label the issue as *Failed*.
    6.  The requester will be responsible for fixing the
        failed hosting bug and will need to raise a new
        '[[https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose][hosting request]]' to get the unit hosted.
    7.  Once the hosting is successful, the requester will
        be responsible for the verification of the hosted
        link.  If the hosting is not as expected, the
        requester should change the label from *Hosted* to
        *Reopened*. The requester will also need to specify
        if he/she would like to revert to the previous
        hosted image.
    8.  An issue with *Reopened* label will by default host
        the repository and branch/tag as specified in the
        hosting request initially. However, if the requester
        has specifically requested a revert, the previously
        hosted image will be restored and issue will be
        labelled as *Reverted*.
    9.  If the requester wants to revert to any earlier
        branch/tag, a new '[[https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose][hosting request]]' will need to be
        raised to get the unit hosted.
    10. Requester will be responsible for closing a hosting
        request issue by changing the issue status from Open
        to Closed when the issue is labelled as *Hosted* or
        *Reopened* or *Reverted* or *Not Approved*.

*** Labels & Status of a Hosting Request 

    At any given time a hosting issue should be marked with
    only one of the following labels. To change the label of
    an issue, the current label of the issue should be
    unchecked and the new label should be checked.

    Hosted :  This label indicates that the hosting request
    has been successful and the hosted url has been shared
    in the hosting request issue. This label is used only by
    the hosting team. 
   
    Failed : This label indicates that the hosting request
    has not been successful. This label is used only by the
    hosting team.

    Reopened : This label is used by the requester to
    indicate that the hosting url provided on a successful
    hosting of the hosting unit is not passing the validation.
   
    Not Approved : This label indicates that the hosting
    request issue raised by the requester was not approved
    by the Repository Owner.  This label is used only by the
    hosting team.
    
    Reverted :  This label indicates that the hosting request
    has been successfully revert to the previous hosted
    image. This label is used only by
    the hosting team. 
    
    Apart from the above mentioned labels a hosting request
    issue can either be in a closed or open status as
    provided by GitHub. 

    Open : This status indicates that a new hosting request
    issue has been raised and is waiting for the services of
    the hosting team. All issues are in this status when
    they are created on GitHub.

    Closed : This status indicates that a hosting request
    has been serviced by the hosting team and is labelled as
    *Hosted* or *Reopened* or *Reverted* or *Not Approved*.

* Central Hosting Data  
  The following information will be stored at a central
  place for a quick reference by the hosting team:
    1. Hosting unit name
    2. Repository URL
    3. Currently hosted Branch/Tag
    4. Previously hosted Branch/Tag
    5. Date/Time of hosting

* Conclusion 
  This document highlights the hosting process of Virtual
  Labs from on-boarding to hosting. It aims at collaborating
  contributions of the developers across the open source
  platform - GitHub. This streamlined process would help in
  our strive for excellence in delivering high standard
  labs.

* Glossary
  - *Repository* : The distributed version control system - git is
    used here. Every time the term repository or repo is used, it
    refers to a git repository. A repository is an on-disk data
    structure which stores metadata for a set of files and/or
    directory structure. The whole set of information in the
    repository may be duplicated on every user's system or may be
    maintained on a single server.
  - *Virtual Labs* : Virtual Labs is an initiative by MHRD
    under NMEICT. The objective of this project is to make
    engineering education engaging, enjoyable, immersive and
    online.
  - *Hosting team*: VLEAD at IIITH which provides Virtual
    Labs hosting service
