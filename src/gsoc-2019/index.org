** 1. Virtual Reality Framework for Building Virtual Labs    
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: project-details-one
 :END:
*** *Description*
    Virtual reality is gradually starting to dominate many aspects of
    our modern life and a variety of industrial sectors. Virtual Labs
    with Virtual Reality will be about providing interactive labs in
    3D view for the students in the web browser. The framework should
    provide a flexibility to add objects and their properties with
    actions, a script so that experiments can be played/conducted in
    Virtual Reality. The Virtual Reality framework should be
    applicable for demonstration to 10 Physical Sciences Labs of our
    organization. The experimental environment should have simulation,
    augmentation, and 3D interaction.
*** *Scope of Work*  
    1. 3D interaction
    2. Providing education with interactive models
    3. Development of simulation labs using VR toolkit
    4. Understanding of Physical Sciences Labs and their existing issues
*** *Technical Requirements*
    1. Unity/OSVR
    2. A-frame
    3. JavaScript
    4. HTML5 and CSS
** 2. Model Driven Development of Chemical Sciences
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: project-details-two
 :END:      
*** *Description* *
    In existing Virtual Chemical Sciences Lab, procedures and
    interaction with lab apparatus are hardwired. We [[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8433505/][prototyped]] a
    model driven approach to make the lab interactive and
    scalable. This provides faculty and students to design new
    experiments. The virtual apparatus and chemicals can be used
    without any fear of reactions and try different 'what if'
    scenarios. The solution of this problem would also help 8th-12th
    grade students who are creative but highly restricted from using
    any chemical solutions and apparatus. Existing Virtual Labs,
    ChemCollective from CMU and Phet Labs from University of Colorado
    have been studied and compared before finalizing this
    approach. The approach also brings in the rigour of model driven
    development and usage of design patterns.
*** *Scope of Work* 
    1. Enhance existing prototype with features to add new apparatus
       and chemicals without a need of a programmer
    2. Improve the Usability of the prototype
    3. Understanding the hows and whys of the reaction
    4. Understand atomic valency to allow/disallow chemical reactions
    5. Generate results for the completed steps of an experiment
    6. Helping easy conclusion drawing method for a reaction
*** *Technical Requirements*
    1. Model Driven Development
    2. Javascript
    3. D3
    4. HTML5 and CSS

** 3. Development of Problem Solving Lab with support for additional programming languages and flexibility to add new problem statements without developer intervention
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: project-details-three
 :END:
*** *Description*
    The existing problem solving lab supports C, C++ as the
    programming languages. There are hints ranging from logic to
    pseudo-code to syntax for guiding students conduct problem solving
    experiments. The problem sets, implementation and test cases are
    predefined with no flexibility to add new programming language and
    new problems. As part of the idea, we plan to provide flexibility
    to program in Java, Javascript, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python, Bash
    Shell along with C and C++. The lab should also be enhanced to
    provide flexibility to add new problems (complexity based), hints,
    test cases, expected output without developer intervention.
*** *Scope of Work* 
    1. Identify a programming interface such as Jupyter Notebook that
       supports multiple programming languages (Java, Javascript, PHP,
       Ruby on Rails, Python, Bash Shell along with C and C)
    2. Enhance to provide an interface for adding new problems,
       related hints, test cases and expected output
*** *Technical Requirements*
    1. HTML5 and CSS
    2. Javascript
    3. Python

** 4. Automatic Generation of Questions and Answers from Reference Text of an Experiment for Data Structures Lab
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: project-details-four
 :END:      
*** *Description*
    Existing experiments have multiple choice questions (MCQ) as an
    assessment. These questions and their corresponding answers are
    all static. Students who have not been able to answer the
    questions for the first time will be able to answer it easily the
    next time. This defeats the purpose and seriousness of conducting
    virtual experiments.
*** *Scope of Work* 
    1. Identify ground truth for each of the experiments in Data
       structures Lab
    2. Use NLP techniques to generate questions and related answers
       (Frameset, Phrase2Vec, etc)
    3. Develop Assessment page with randomized Q&A
    4. Build a repeatable process to generate MCQ based on provided
       ground truth in text/prescribed format
*** *Technical Requirements*
    1. NLP parsers
    2. ML algorithms
    3. HTML and CSS
    4. Javascript
** 5. Visualization of data present in Outreach portal
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: project-details-five
 :END:
*** *Description*
    [[http://outreach.vlabs.ac.in/][Outreach portal]] contains data of Virtual Labs usage conducted
    through outreach programs. The data is collected at college ,
    Nodal coordinator conducting at various colleges, Institute
    coordinator overseeing Nodal Coordinators and Principal
    Investigator responsible of Institute Coordinator.  The data
    contains information on usage (location, labs, time period, target
    vs actual and so on). This data needs to be represented at various
    roles using D3 visualization.
*** *Scope of Work* 
    1. Understanding data model of Outreach portal
    2. Identifying various charts required
    3. Building various charts/graphs using D3
*** *Technical Requirements*
    1. MySQL
    2. Python
    3. D3 js
    4. Javascript

** 6. Visualization of Virtual Experiments Online Usage
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: project-details-six
 :END:
*** *Description*
    Data visualization on demand based on a given parameter such as
    site visitor account, number of page views, resources download,
    labwise usage, user time spent on each experiment, day, month and
    year wise usage etc., helps to understand Virtual Labs usefulness
    and usability to students. However, experiments are built by
    developers across locations and that created a challenge in
    bringing consistency for drawing data on extent of usage of
    experiments.  Having a utility that does not (minimally) intrudes
    into the code to gather usage of experiments will help in
    enhancing experiments - usability, usefulness and additional
    topics.
*** *Scope of Work* 
    1. Identify tools that can generate analytics in web applications
       with minimal/non intrusive code
    2. List the analytics that can be generated with the shortlisted
       tools
    3. Identify an approach/utility for incorporating the change in
       all 1100+ experiments
    4. Test the generated analytics
*** *Technical Requirements*
    1. Javascript
    2. Ajax
    3. Web Server Configurations that includes Apache and Nginx
    4. Shell Scripting
    5. Google Analytics
    6. Kibana

    9. Mysql/MongoDB

** 7. Conversion of 10 Experiments from Flash to Javascript
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: project-details-seven
 :END:
*** *Description*
    Converting Flash based Virtual Labs to Javascript due to the
    following reasons: 
    1. An announcement from Adobe Flash Player that it will stop
       supporting flash for the browsers by 2020, due to which users
       will no longer have any ability to run Flash based applications
    2. Browsers do not have inbuilt support for Flash, the user has to
       add it themselves as an addon and enable Flash every time they
       run Flash based application.
    3. Flash is not supported in most of the mobile devices including
       Apple ipads, iphones etc.,
    which has become a regular device for students and faculty to
    access internet Our approach for approximately 35 experiments has
    been to decompile swf to get scripts and use the scripts(images)
    to recreate the experiments using Javascript. However, this is
    painful and time taking.
*** *Scope of Work* 
    1. Understand functionality of Computer Organization experiments
    2. Build a utility that can be used to model new experiments or a
       utility that decompiles to get Actionscript and generates
       Javascript
    3. Test the functionality after changes
*** *Technical Requirements*
    1. HTML5 and CSS
    2. Javascript
    3. Action Script
    4. Python/C/Java for building utility 

** 8. Converting Java3D Labs to WebGL 
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: project-details-eight
 :END:
*** *Description*
    VLSI and Digital Logic Design labs are using Java3D for experiment
    simulation. Java3D has is deprecated and Virtual Labs had to keep
    a library in GitHub repository to support usage of the labs. The
    experiments in these labs need to be migrated to WebGL/GWT from
    Java3D.
*** *Scope of Work* 
    1. Understanding the functionality and usage of VLSI and Digital
       Logic Design Labs
    2. Implement the functionality using WebGL/GWT
    3. Test the implementation
*** *Technical Requirements*
    1. Javascript
    2. WebGL/GWT
    3. Java3D
    4. HTML and CSS

** 9. NLP lab from PHP to Javascript
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: project-details-nine
 :END:
*** *Description*
    All 10 experiments of the existing Natural Language Processing [[https://nlp-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/][Lab]]
    are built on PHP requiring server side components, making it
    vulnerable to attackers, slow in performance and does not provide
    rich UI. The experiments of the lab need to be converted to
    Javascript while making it responsive in design, scalable to
    multiple instances based on usage and has less than 3-5 seconds
    response time.
*** *Scope of Work* 
    1. Understand the functionality of the experiments
    2. Convert the PHP Lab to Javascript
    3. Fix the existing functionality issues logged on [[https://github.com/virtual-labs/natural-language-processing-iiith/issues][GitHub]]
    4. Make the lab responsive in design and align to Virtual Labs
       Usability guidelines

    4. MySQL
    5. XML/JSON

** 10. Containerize Virtual Labs for optimizing resource usage
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: project-details-ten
 :END:
*** *Description*
    Labs contain 8-10 experiments and each lab is hosted on a separate
    virtual machine instance. Some labs use Client side scripting and
    some use server side code such as Apache, MySQL, Java, PHP, etc.
    The usage of the experiments vary based on the month and time of
    the day. Movement of these labs from virtual instances to
    containers such as Docker with Kubernetes as Orchestration layer
    would optimize the usage.
*** *Scope of Work* 
    1. Identify labs that can be hosted on Docker containers
    2. Finalization of Virtual Machine requirement for installing
       Docker
    3. Dockerization of labs
